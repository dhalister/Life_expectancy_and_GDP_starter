Instructions for this project from Codecademy.com:

For this project, you will analyze data on GDP and life expectancy from the World Health Organization and the World Bank to try and identify the relationship between the GDP and life expectancy of six countries.

During this project, you will analyze, prepare, and plot data in order to answer questions in a meaningful way.

After you perform your analysis, youâ€™ll be creating a blog post to share your findings on the World Health Organization website.
